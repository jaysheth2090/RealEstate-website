        <p>We are proud that we have been selected to advise on many of  the largest transactions and restructuring assignments in the industry  involving many billions of dollars.&nbsp; In  the interest of our clients, we are intentionally keeping the names and terms  confidential.&nbsp; Here are some examples  from 2008 and 2009:</p>
<strong><h7>Home Builder Valuation: </h7></strong><br><p>We conducted market  research to determine the appropriate revenue assumptions for a very large home  builder and master planned community developer.&nbsp;  In four weeks, we visited 100+ projects, created cash flows and value estimates for each asset,  and provided additional input on product repositioning to increase the potential  value. </p>
<strong><h7>Consumer Research:</h7></strong><br> <p>We ran a successful consumer research program, including focus groups and more  than 500 internet survey participants, to help a builder design the right  community with the right community amenities and product segmentation.We estimated that we improved profitability by several million dollars by reducing expenditures the consumer wouldn't pay for and providing specific product and marketing recommendations.</p>
<strong><h7>Feasibility Studies:</h7></strong><br> <p>We have provided all <a href="/5-levels-feasibility">5 levels of Feasibility Analysis</a> for numerous  clients on properties all over the country.   We serve as an in-house market research team or as a second  opinion.  Our seasoned building  executives are particularly adept at determining the appropriate specification  levels and the most effective use of marketing dollars.  </p>
<strong><h7>Product Optimization</h7></strong>:<br><p>We  have done many optimization studies in order to maximize profit.  This includes defining the right product, the  right density, and the right cost in order to maximize the net present value.  Our strategic plan(s) also consider all of  the steps needed to change product along with the local jurisdiction and  timeline associated with change.  Our  results are realistic, actionable and profitable.</p>
<strong><h7>Market  Feasibility for a Master Planned Community: </h7></strong><br><p>For a mothballed Master Planned Community, we addressed the challenge of  the property’s location: miles from central core but with unique site  characteristics. The project was in a distressed market, but one with long-term  growth potential. Within three weeks, we provided insight on current and future finished lot supply and our  expectations of when supply and demand would become more balanced.</p>
<strong><h7>Loan Restructuring: </h7></strong><br><p>On  behalf of a Banking Group needing to restructure a very large revolving loan, our  team conducted market feasibility, cash flows and valuation on more than 150  new home communities in 8 states. Our recommendations to maximize recovery of  the loan were presented in 10 weeks, helped the Banking Group focus, and were  the basis for the group’s restructuring strategy.</p>
<strong><h7>Bankruptcy Reorganization Plan: </h7></strong><br><p>We evaluated the  bankruptcy reorganization plan of a private real estate company with over 50  commercial and residential real estate assets. &nbsp;In one week, we analyzed appraisals and  provided expert local opinion on all major assets.&nbsp; Later, we refined our analysis by providing  valuation and cash flow analysis for each asset. We built a detailed cash flow  model incorporating different economic assumptions to estimate possible return  scenarios. </p>
<strong><h7>Distressed Real  Estate Investment Evaluation: </h7></strong><br><p>On behalf of an investor contemplating an  equity injection in a land development and home building company, we provided  pricing and absorption recommendations and forecasted market conditions and  cash flows for 40+ future communities from our desktop, with significant  information provided by the builder.</p>
<strong><h7>Bulk Land Sale: </h7></strong><br><p>On  behalf of a large home builder and land developer, we provided a valuation  recommendation of over 60 subdivisions in 23 master planned communities in 5  states. Our market research and cash flow model was provided to bidders for  their use to expedite the bidding process. Our assignment was completed in less  than 30 days.</p>
<strong><h7>Portfolio Review and  SWOT Analysis: </h7></strong><br><p>We reviewed a multi-billion dollar portfolio in the Southeast,  providing an asset and valuation review of these assets. We provided a summary  of market health, price forecast, and potential strengths and weaknesses to  consider regarding these investments. We completed this complex analysis in just  three weeks.</p>
<strong><h7>Joint Venture  Investment Assistance: </h7></strong><br><p>We provided pricing and absorption recommendations  for 14 subdivisions to help two of our clients come to terms in less than 30  days.</p>
<strong><h7>Commercial and  Residential Loan Valuation: </h7></strong><br><p>We assisted a Private Equity Group in their due  diligence efforts in valuing a Regional Bank by visiting each property and then  valuing the Bank’s portfolio of performing and non-performing loan assets. The  assets included permanent and construction loans for commercial properties  (Office, Industrial and Retail) as well as residential land development and  home construction loans.</p>
<strong><h7>Appraisal Review: </h7></strong><br><p>We  reviewed all of the appraisals and cash flows for a $1 billion+ portfolio  transaction. &nbsp;We included a summary of  the strengths and weaknesses for each property as it relates to their  financials, entitlement, segmentation, and price positioning. We provided this  analysis in just three weeks.</p>
<strong><h7>Home Builder  Valuation in Bankruptcy Court: </h7></strong><br><p>For an unsecured creditors committee, we visited  and valued more than 100 new home communities to determine which communities  had equity value.</p>
<strong><h7>Land Portfolio  Valuation in Bankruptcy Court: </h7></strong><br><p>On behalf of the debtor and secured  creditors, our team valued a multi-billion dollar portfolio of land holdings  for use in negotiations with a judge and unsecured creditor’s committee.</p>
<strong><h7>Construction Loan  Portfolio Valuation: </h7></strong><br><p>In less than two weeks, our team valued more than $600  million of construction loans for the acquirer of a bank, using our proprietary  loan valuation model.&nbsp; </p>
<strong><h7>Construction Loan  Portfolio Review: </h7></strong><br><p>We provided a range of land values on more than 300  construction loans by reviewing comps and interviewing brokers and appraisers  for a bank’s internal analysis.</p>
<strong><h7>Ongoing Portfolio  Review</h7></strong>:<br> <p>We are on retainer with several private equity firms who have  become reluctant owners of very large portfolios, helping them maximize the  return on each asset. &nbsp;We update market  conditions and make suggestions each quarter.</p>
